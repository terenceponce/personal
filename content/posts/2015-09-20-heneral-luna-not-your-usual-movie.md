Just watched Heneral Luna and it definitely lived up to the hype that it got from the people in my network.

As someone who found Philippine history to be boring during school (let alone almost fails the class), I probably would have been more interested if this movie were to show during my school years instead of just now.

The story telling is incredible, the pacing is just right and it had a good amount of comedy mixed in between the scenes. Time flew so fast that I didn’t realize I was watching a 2 hour movie. I never got bored even in the dialog-heavy scenes.

The acting is also top notch. Not to mention the actors almost look like the actual people they’re portraying. The cinematography is also great. I’ve never felt that the movie was cheap at any point in time. If you told me this was an American-made film, I would have believed you because the quality is just that good.

If you’re still on the fence about watching Heneral Luna, I suggest you do it already because not only are you going to watch a good movie, but you’re also supporting the local film industry and encouraging film makers to push movies of this quality to the main stream viewing public. We need to let these film makers know that we want to watch movies that make sense.
