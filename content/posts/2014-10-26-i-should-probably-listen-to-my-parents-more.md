A few weeks ago, I applied for a variable life insurance through a friend who’s a financial agent. Well, I went through it despite my mother asking me to consult her first. She used to be an insurance agent, so she knows what’s up.

I never realize how much of a mistake I was making until she pointed it out. She said I was basically screwing myself over because of my ignorance on the subject.

The more I get older, the more I realize that my parents were pretty awesome at what they did during their prime despite how they seem very lame and uninteresting.
