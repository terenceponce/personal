My name is Terence Ponce. I work as a software developer for a living.

I'm known for being the community manager of the [Philippine Ruby Users Group](https://pinoyrb.org/) and the former VP for Technology of [Developers Connect Philippines](https://devcon.ph).

This website is a place where I post about things that I’m invested in. The content you’ll see here is mostly personal with a few technical articles posted every now and then, so this site won’t be that interesting to most people.
